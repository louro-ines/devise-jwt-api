# RAILS DEVISE JWT

Devise-JWT is an extension for the Devise authentication framework that utilizes JSON Web Tokens (JWT) for user authentication. When using JSON Web Tokens, a token is included in the request headers. This token is managed by the front-end framework and is typically added as part of an AJAX call.
